\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:RelatedWork}
In this section, we give background information on relevant concepts and techniques that are touched in our work. We start with a taxonomy of dependability in Section \ref{subsec:fault}. This includes a discussion of intrusions and methods to avoid or tolerate them. Section \ref{sec:Recovery} introduces the main intrusion recovery techniques. Each of the following sections describe a number of relevant proposals for recovery in the levels where PaaS applications are attacked: operating system, database and application. Finally, Section \ref{sec:Discuss} discusses the contributions of these works in the context of this work.
