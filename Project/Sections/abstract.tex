We introduce a novel service for Platform as a Service (PaaS) systems that gives system administrators the power to recover their applications from intrusions. The motivation for this work is the increasing number of intrusions and critical applications in the cloud and the emergence of the PaaS model. We introduce a new service where security intrusions in PaaS applications are removed and tolerated. The proposed architecture will support the removal of intrusions due to software flaws, corrupted user requests and support system corrective and preventive maintenance. This document surveys the existing intrusion recovery techniques, identifies their limitations and proposes an architecture to build a new service for intrusion recovery in PaaS. An evaluation methodology is proposed in order to validate the proposed architecture.
