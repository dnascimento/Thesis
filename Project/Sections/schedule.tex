The service implementation will be implemented and evaluated in phases. At the first phase, we will design the testing tool, the proxy and the demo application. At the second phase, we will handle the dependency auditors and graph. At the latest phase, we will develop the capability to perform parallel replay and integrate with a PaaS system. After, we will perform the measurements and evaluation. More details about the schedule are available in the Appendix \ref{sec:DetailedSchedule}.
